# Welcome to Norigin Challenge

This project was created from an empty folder, developing every feature needed

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run start:api`

It will strt the "backend" service provided for this challenge

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm run build:test`

With http-server we will be able to see the producction build on [http://localhost:9080](http://localhost:9080)

## How to run the project

We will need to run two commands on different consoles for this. On one console we should run `npm run start:api` to make the backend service work

And on the other console we will start our React project with the command `npm run start`
